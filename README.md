# project2

## Briefing 
### For project 2, I've decided to code a Website for Gym & Memberships. This project can be quite dynamic and interesting with all its tools and elements regarding the live version. 

## Structured layout: 
# My goal was to create a website that would be easy for all users across the globe to access and use. The menu of the main website consists of: 
- Homepage: explain gym services, show image sliders, and key information
- Membership Page: type of memberships, pricing, and calculation tool of membership contract period
- Contact Page: Contact form where users can fill in required details and ask any sort of questions. 
- About Us Page: Features gym info, trainer bios, etc.

# Manual Testing for Website

## 1. Functionality Testing
### Navigation:
Check if external links or buttons open the correct pages.
The home page opens quite smoothly without any issues, loading all the text and images in a few seconds.
### On home page there is a button "sign up now" When user click will pop-up a sign-up form, where user after filling in the form will have to press submit, and there will be a message saying that someone will contact them in the next 48 hours. 
The membership page operates at the same speed, however, when click on membership type you need to scroll down to check and calculate the membership cost.
The about Us web page is quite simple with some information about the owner and gym itself. 
The contact page is another form where users can send send certain question before they decide to sign up for any memberships. 

### Forms:
Validate required fields by submitting without inputs.
Test form submissions with valid and invalid data.
Check for user feedback messages after form submission.

### Dynamic Elements:
Test buttons like "Select Plan" or "Calculate Total Cost" for expected behavior.

### Error Handling:
Simulate errors like incorrect inputs in forms to confirm proper handling.

## 2. Usability Testing
### Design:
Assess the readability and clarity of content.
Check for consistent fonts, spacing, and alignment.
Ease of Navigation:
Confirm intuitive menu placement and navigation flow.
Test hover effects and active link highlights for user clarity.

## 3. Responsiveness Testing
### Screen Sizes:
Test layout and elements on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Check if images, text, and sections adapt correctly.
### Browser Compatibility:
Test the website on popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# Automated Testing
