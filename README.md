# Presentation of Project 2

## Briefing 
### For project 2, I've decided to code a Website for Gym & Memberships. This project is dynamic and interesting with all its tools and elements regarding the live version. 

## Structured layout: 
# My goal was to create a website that would be easy for all users across the globe to access and use. The menu of the main website consists of: 
- Homepage: explain gym services, show image sliders, and key information
- Membership Page: type of memberships, pricing, and calculation tool of membership contract period
- Contact Page: Contact form where users can fill in required details and ask any questions. 
- About Us Page: Features gym info, trainer bios, etc.

# Manual Testing for Website

## 1. Functionality Testing
### Navigation:
I checked if all the links and buttons were working correctly. 
The home page opens smoothly without any issues, loading all the text and images in a few seconds.
### On the home page there is a button "sign up now" When the user clicks will pop-up a sign-up form, where the user after filling in the form will have to press submit, and there will be a message saying that someone will contact them in the next 48 hours.

The membership page operates at the same speed, however, when click on membership type you need to scroll down to check and calculate the membership cost.

The About Us web page is quite simple with some information about the owner and gym itself. 
The contact page is another form where users can send certain questions before they decide to sign up for any memberships.

### Forms:
all validated, and the user will automatically see the message when to form has been sent. 

### Dynamic Elements:
I tested buttons like "Select Plan" or "Calculate Total Cost" for expected behaviour and no issues have been found. 

## 2. Usability Testing
### Design:
The readability and contrast of the website is smooth and straightforward. No hidden parts/messages, where the user would have to wonder what to do next. 
Fonts, spacing and alignments are consistent with no huge differences between each page of the website. 
### Ease of Navigation:
Everything works smoothly, and it's easy to navigate through the website and the layout. 

## 3. Responsiveness Testing
### Screen Sizes:
I Tested the layout and elements on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
images, text, and sections adapt correctly.
### Browser Compatibility:
I also tested the website on popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# Automated Testing

## 1. Tools
Validators:

HTML Validator (W3C Validator).
- all checked and without issues
  
CSS Validator (W3C CSS Validation).
- all checked and without issues. 

## 2. Key Areas
### Accessibility:

colour contrast and text size are proportionate, with the combination of darker colours and whites in some parts. 

### Performance:
I Analyzed load time and it takes up to 2,3 seconds to fully open each page of the website. 

#### Responsive Design:
Both desktop & mobile website versions are up to date, and users can easily navigate through without experiencing any issues.
