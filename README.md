# project2

## Briefing 
### For project 2, I've decided to code a Website for Gym & Memberships. This project can be quite dynamic and intersting with all its tools and elements when comes to live version. 

## Structured layout: 
# My goal was to create a website that would be easy for all users across the globe to access and use. The menu of the main websit consists of: 
- Homepage: explain gym services, shows image sliders, and key information
- Membership Page: type of memberships, pricing, and sign-up form
- Contact Page: Contact form validated via JavaScript
- About Us Page: Features gym info, trainer bios, etc.
