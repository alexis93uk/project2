# project2

## Briefing 
### For project 2, I've decided to code a Website for Gym & Memberships. This project can be quite dynamic and intersting with all its tools and elements when comes to live version. 

## Structured layout: 
# My goal was to create a website that would be easy for all users across the globe to access and use. The menu of the main websit consists of: 
- Homepage: explain gym services, shows image sliders, and key information
- Membership Page: type of memberships, pricing, and sign-up form
- Contact Page: Contact form validated via JavaScript
- About Us Page: Features gym info, trainer bios, etc.

# Manual Testing for Website

## 1. Functionality Testing
Navigation:
Test each link (Home, Memberships, About Us, Contact) to ensure they navigate to the intended sections/pages.
Check if external links or buttons open the correct pages.
Forms:
Validate required fields by submitting without inputs.
Test form submissions with valid and invalid data.
Check for user feedback messages after form submission.
Dynamic Elements:
Test buttons like "Select Plan" or "Calculate Total Cost" for expected behavior.
Error Handling:
Simulate errors like incorrect inputs in forms to confirm proper handling.

## 2. Usability Testing
### Design:

Test hover effects and active link highlights for user clarity.

## 3. Responsiveness Testing

### Browser Compatibility:
Test the website on popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
